            <h1>HelpSpot developer role hypesheet</h1>
            <p>Hello Ian, Dave, and the UserScape team,</p>
            <p>My name is Erik, and I am very excited to apply for the HelpSpot developer role. I've been following Ian's work for a while (huge fan of the podcast) and the opportunity to work on longstanding, meaningful products like HelpSpot and Larajobs in a small and  supportive team setting is a dream job for me. Working on dynamic products like these alongside the satisfaction of helping people achieve their needs is exactly what I'm looking for in a position.</p>
            <p>I think I would be a great fit for this role because of my experience working with Laravel and legacy PHP applications together. I also have a strong background in supporting open source communities and cloud hosting solutions and a people-centric approach to work. I've outlined some specific instances of this below along with relevant examples from my personal and work experience. Thanks for checking out my <a href="{{ route('home') }}">personal site</a>, which includes my <a href="{{ route('resume') }}">resume</a>, some personal <a href="{{ route('projects') }}">project highlights</a>, and this page specifically for this application with embedded links.</p>
            <p>Through my current role as a full-stack developer with the <a href="https://pkp.sfu.ca" target="_blank">Public Knowledge Project</a>, I have experience working with a 20+-year-old PHP codebase, both helping to maintain bespoke legacy features and modernizing the application to work with the latest Laravel and Vue conventions. For example, I've recently been working on a project to bring third-party plugin functionality into the core of our application, which involved maintaining existing functionality, incorporating new UI/UX research, and breaking up a massive plugin class into discrete, readable classes. I am also comfortable working with the challenges of multilingualism and localization in application development. My experience working on an <a href="https://github.com/pkp/ojs" target="_blank">academic journal publishing platform</a> used around the globe has given me invaluable insight into the challenges of both the strict coding challenges of working internationalization and localization, but also the attention to detail require when working with localized data in a global context.</p>
            <p>I also have a strong background in working with products deployed across a wide variety of hosting environments from first-party cloud solutions to the wild west of self-hosted instances of open source projects. I have experience across a broad spectrum of users types—from working with cloud hosting clients to enhance and troubleshoot their installations on the latest version of a product running PHP 8 to open source users self-hosting a 5+-year-old installation on PHP 5.6. For example with these clients, I have completed custom work such as product theming and integrations with services like Algolia.</p>
            <p>Finally, I would like to highlight my people-centric approach to all of my work, which positions me well in a role like this where customer support and technical skills are equally valued. My experience prior to being a developer comes from the library/publishing world, which has a very strong emphasis on empathy and understanding. The customer-first approach to this role is a huge appeal to me—while I love working on challenging coding problems, I find my work most rewarding when I can combine all my skills to help people make the most of the services I provide. If I can't help people have a positive experience working with a product, then I have not succeeded. I know this can sometimes surface in the little things—I was recently on a support call with a client who self-hosted our product, and we just couldn't figure out what was going wrong. We finally tried the classic "turn-it-off-and-on-again" (uninstalling and reinstalling a plugin). It worked! We had a good laugh and were able to leave the call happy, having all accomplished our goals.</p>
            <p>Thank you very much for your consideration.</p>
            <p>
                Best,<br>
